# My Helper Scripts

Welcome to my personal collection of helper scripts! This repository includes various Python and PowerShell scripts that I use for automating tasks and simplifying processes.

## Scripts

1. **Taskbar Preview Toggle Script** (`toggle_taskbar_preview.ps1`)
   - Toggles the taskbar preview window feature on or off in Windows.

2. **Email Password Sorter** (`email_password_sorter.py`)
   - Sorts email-password pairs by provider and address, and generates a sorted output file.

3. **File Mover Script** (`file_mover.py`)
   - Moves all files from subdirectories to the root directory and removes empty directories.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bradselph/My-Helper-Scripts.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd My-Helper-Scripts
   ```

## Running Scripts

- **Taskbar Preview Toggle Script:** Run `toggle_taskbar_preview.ps1` in PowerShell.
- **Email Password Sorter:** Execute `email_password_sorter.py` with Python.
